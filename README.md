# Real-time Sign Language Recognition in Python

This project implements a real-time sign language recognition system using Python. The system captures video from your webcam and uses a machine learning model to classify the hand gestures into corresponding sign language characters.
## Features
##### 1.Real-time video capture using OpenCV
##### 2.Sign language gesture recognition with a Convolutional Neural Network Model 
##### 3.Visual feedback on the recognized characters
